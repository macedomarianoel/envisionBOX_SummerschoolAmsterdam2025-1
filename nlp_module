# envision_summerschool_nlpmodule

This module is part of the **EnvisionBOX Summer School**, held at the University of Amsterdam from **23–27 June 2025**. It introduces early career researchers to practical NLP techniques for analyzing literary, dialogic, and multimodal data. The focus is on hands-on, interpretable pipelines deployable via both **GitHub** and **Google Colab**.

## 🔍 Focus: NLP for Multimodal Dramatic Texts
This module works with Shakespearean scenes (e.g., *Romeo and Juliet*), including transcripts from the **Tragic Talkers** dataset (Berghi et al., 2022), to explore syntax, affect, dialogue structure, character modeling, and creative generation using accessible Python tools.

**Note:** The dataset is used under academic fair use as described by the original license. You must cite:
