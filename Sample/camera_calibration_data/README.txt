Cameras are calibrated with respect to the central camera of AVA1 (i.e. cam06) used as the origin of the world.

In order to use the two rigs independently as two separate egocentric devices, that is using the central camera of AVA2 (cam17) as the origin of the world for AVA2, simply use the extrinsic data of AVA1 on AVA2 too.
