  No frames needed to be interpolated.

--> Mean reprojection error for all points on frames 0 to 100 is 10.6 px, which roughly corresponds to 19.3 mm. 
Cameras were excluded if likelihood was below 0.3 and if the reprojection error was above 15 px.
Gaps were interpolated with linear method if smaller than 10 frames. Larger gaps were filled with the last valid value.
In average, 0.25 cameras had to be excluded to reach these thresholds.
Camera cam03 was excluded 16% of the time, Camera cam04: 5%, Camera cam01: 3%, and Camera cam02: 1%.

Cannot read video. Frame rate will be set to 60 fps.
Inference run only every 4 frames. Inbetween, pose estimation tracks previously detected points.

Estimating pose...
Using HALPE_26 model (body and feet) for pose estimation.

No valid CUDA installation found: using OpenVINO backend with CPU.

Pose tracking set up for "Body_with_feet" model.
Mode: balanced.
Tracking is performed with sports2d.

Found image folders with mp4 extension.

Pose estimation took 00h00m02s.
